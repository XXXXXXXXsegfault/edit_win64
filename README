"edit" -- A Text Editor.

*Modes*

"edit" has four modes: Normal Mode, Insert Mode, Select Mode,
and Command Mode.
You can determine the current mode by viewing the line at the
bottom of the window.
The Normal Mode is the initial mode of "edit". To switch back
to normal mode from other modes, you can press the ESC key.

In any modes except the Command Mode, you can move the
cursor by pressing direction keys.

In the Normal Mode and Select Mode, character inputs will be
interpreted as commands.

In the Insert Mode, typing a character will insert it into the
text at the current cursor position, and pressing BACKSPACE
will delete the character before the current cursor position.

In the Select Mode, you can select text for copy and cut 
operations.

In the Command Mode, you can use some multi-character commands.
After you type the full command, press ENTER to issue it.
